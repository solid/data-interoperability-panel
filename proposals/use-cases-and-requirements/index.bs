Abstract: Use Cases and Requirements for the Solid ecosystem.
</pre>

Introduction {#intro}
=====================

Issue: Needs explaination how proposals should clearly reference requirements which they satisfy. As well as requirements they do not satisfy due to some limitations.

Requirements {#requirements}
============================

## The system is not abusable

<div class="assertion" heading="Use cases">

* [[#evil-fitness-tracker]]

</div>

## An app can request access to a specific resource

<div class="assertion" heading="Use cases">

* [[#simple-game]]
* [[#rdf-editor]]
* [[#pod-administration]]

</div>

## An app can request access to a specific type of data without knowing the structure of resources on a Pod

<div class="assertion" heading="Use cases">

* [[#chat-with-friends]]
* [[#discussion-boards]]
* [[#photos-viewer]]
* [[#photos-processing]]

</div>

## Access requests can be sent when the resource owner is not present to be approved once the user is present

## Apps can request the ability to write a specific type of data and will be told where it should write it

<div class="assertion" heading="Use cases">

* [[#photos-processing]]

</div>

## It should be possible for an agent to block/allow certain apps from accessing a specific resource as that agent

## It should be possible for an agent with Control access to block/allow certain apps from accessing a specific resource as any agent

<div class="assertion" heading="Use cases">

* [[#chat-with-doctor]]

</div>

## It should be easy to allow others accessing your resources to use apps you're okay without requiring your explicit consent.

## Access to specific types of data should extend to new resources that contain that data

## Access to specific types of data should not expose other data that was not requested

## Data should have different levels of requirements for user's conciousness in consent

## The authorization data is easily cachable

## Information about Clients (apps) to which users have granted access and what specific access they have delegated should not be made available to Resource Servers that do not enforce relevant access restrictions on those Clients.

## Resource controller should be able to keep access rules confidential

<div class="assertion" heading="Requirements">

* [[#whistleblower]]

</div>

Use Cases {#use-cases}
======================

Issue: Each use case needs an author who can provide further clarifications as needed.

## Simple game

 - Alice uses https://simplegame.example to play a singleplayer game
    - Simplegame only needs some file somewhere that it can write its own configuration to. It does not care where it is
    - Simpleapp will also need to access this file again even if it’s being used on another machine

<div class="assertion" heading="Requirements">

* [[#an-app-can-request-access-to-a-specific-resource]]

</div>

## Chat with friends
 - Alice uses https://chat.o.team to chat with her friends

    - Wants access to chat related data that was created after it asked for permission to read them
    - Wants to be alerted when new chat related data has been added to the Pod
    - Wants to create chat related data

<div class="assertion" heading="Requirements">

</div>


## Chat with doctor

 - Alice uses https://doctorChat.example to chat with her doctor
    - DoctorChat wants to create chat related data specifically about medical information
    - DoctorChat wants to ensure Alice has given explicit consent to view the chats that it created before other apps can view this data

<div class="assertion" heading="Requirements">

    - Discussions on https://acme.example/
    - Discussion on https://yoyodyne.example/
  - She wants to receive push notifications on devices she uses when someone replies to discussion she participates in - iSay inculdes a remote client component which provides that feature.
  - Alice, ACME and Yoyodyne want to allow each person with access to discussion boards on their resource servers to decide which applications they trust to participate in those discussions.
  - Alice only wants to allow iSay to access discussions to avoid other apps (eg. games) she tries to have any way of posting spam messges in any of those discussions

## Evil fitness tracker

 - Alice accidentally uses https://evilfitbit.example to track her fitness data
    - Evilfitbit will try to do everything to get Alice’s financial data while pretending to just track her fitness data (This should not be allowed)

<div class="assertion" heading="Requirements">

* [[#the-system-is-not-abusable]]

</div>

## Finances tracker

 - Alice uses, is developing, or is testing an app deployed to http://localhost:8080
    - Note that Alice's Identity Provider can't reach Alice's `localhost:8080`
    - Note that Alice's Pod can't reach Alice's `localhost:8080`
 - Alice uses an app deployed behind a NAT or firewall (while her browser is also behind the same NAT or firewall) that accesses resources outside the NAT or firewall; for example, Alice uses https://coolcode.int.enterprise.example to edit code stored in Customer Bob's Pod
    - *CoolCode* is deployed behind Enterprise.Example's company firewall and is not dereferenceable from the outside, for example because
      - *CoolCode* is proprietary to Enterprise.Example; or
      - *CoolCode* is a commercial product that is deployed on-premises at Enterprise.Example's datacenter
    - Note that Alice's Identity Provider can't reach https://coolcode.int.enterprise.example
    - Note that Customer Bob's Pod can't reach https://coolcode.int.enterprise.example

## Custom TLS CA
 - Alice uses https://photoOrganizer.example to organize photos on her company's private storage server https://storage.private.enterprise.example
    - `storage.private.enterprise.example`'s TLS certificate is signed by Enterprise.Example's private Certificate Authority
    - Alice's web browser is configured to trust Enterprise.Example's private Certificate Authority
    - `storage.private.enterprise.example` is reachable from the public Internet, so Alice's Identity Provider and *photoOrganizer* could reach it; however, neither is configured to trust Enterprise.Example's private Certificate Authority

 - Alice publishes her reports on site run by journalist organization she trusts
 - Alice wants it kept confidential that she created those posts
