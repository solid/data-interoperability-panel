### Discovery Result ### {#sec-amd-result}

If the response to dereferencing an [=Entity's=] [=Identifier=] contains an
[HTTP] [:Link:] header, the [=Link Context=] of which is the [=Entity's=]
[=Identifier=] (e.g. `https://my.id/doc#me`), and the [=Relation Type=] of which
is `http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/interop#hasAgentManager`, the [=Agent=] [SHOULD] take the [=Link Target=] of
the header to be the URL of the [=Agent Manager=] of that [=Entity=]. 

If no such header is present, and the response contains an [=RDF Document=]
&mdash; the [=Identifier=] is [=RDF-Dereferenceable=] &mdash; the [=Agent=]
[MAY] parse it. If the document contains an [=RDF Triple=] linking the
[=Identifier=] of the [=Entity=] to a URL with the predicate
`interop:hasAgentManager`, `rdfs:seeAlso`, or `pim:preferencesFile`, the
[=Agent=] [SHOULD] take the object value to be the URL of the [=Entity's=]
[=Agent Manager=]. 

In case an [=Agent=] has found no [=Agent Manager=] in the response header or
response body after dereferencing an [=Entity's=] [=Identifier=] to its
[=Identity Document=], the requesting [=Agent=] [SHOULD] take there to be no
[=Agent Manager=] for that [=Identifier=], and the [=Agent=] [SHOULD] take the
public [=Resources=] discoverable from the [=Identity Document=] to contain the
only information immediately available.
