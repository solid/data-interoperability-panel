   <p>The principle of universality allows the Web to work no matter what hardware,
software, network connection or language you use, to handle information of all
types and qualities. We now have the technologies and the opportunity to extend
this spirit of universality to our data on the web, and the applications and
services we use to access and manipulate that data.</p>
   <p>Solid allows information and media of all types to be stored, connected, and
accessed over the Web by authorized entities and applications. Linked Data
allows this information to be self-identifying, which makes it understandable
with confidence by any application that knows how to interpret the Linked Data
vocabularies and relationships in use.</p>
   <p>This relatively simple foundation establishes a basis for us to decouple data
from applications. Solid affords us the opportunity to create a valuable and
powerful ecosystem where people and organizations retain control of their data,
but are also able to put it to work and use it to its full potential. The
fundamentals of Solid make this possible, but further definition of standard
methods and mechanisms must be established to make it practical, intuitive, and
secure.</p>

   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2.1" id="disparate"><span class="secno">2.1. </span><span class="content">Disparate applications cannot practically interoperate over the same data safely and effectively</span><a class="self-link" href="#disparate"></a></h3>
   <p>An individual who stores data in their Pod needs the ability to use different
applications to manipulate some or all of the same information, even if those
applications were developed without any knowledge of each other.</p>
   <p>Consider the operating system on your personal computer. You have a diverse set
of data stored on your local drive, from spreadsheets and documents to libraries
of media. We have well-established cases where applications developed by
completely different entities can interoperate over the same files, based on
conformance with agreed upon file formats. These widely used examples of
interoperability pop up in common workflows, but generally these cases are few
and far between. Data interoperability has always been an afterthought in our
personal computing ecosystem, and we’ve been left to deal with incompatibilities
and silos of information as a result. In Solid, our interoperability needs are
even more challenging, but the end result can also be much more exciting. Solid
allows us to work with much richer datasets, and the Web lets us interconnect
them.</p>
   <p>While Solid is the perfect foundation to facilitate this decentralized web-scale
interoperability, to date the recipe has been missing a small but important
assortment of ingredients to get it right.</p>
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="2.1.1" id="disparate-goal"><span class="secno">2.1.1. </span><span class="content">Goal: Seamless data interoperability across disparate applications</span><a class="self-link" href="#disparate-goal"></a></h4>
   <p>Decoupling data from applications and making it fully interoperable across any
of them is a core goal of Solid, not an afterthought. Our aim is for nearly all
of the data to be interoperable and reusable. Our Linked Data model is extremely
expressive. We can store all kinds of information about real-world entities and
digital artifacts, including the relationships between them. Interoperability
across applications means they must be able understand and manipulate these
complex representations of things in concert with other applications that are
reading and writing them at the same time.</p>
   <p>Applications must be able to find and understand the data pertinent to them,
then modify it without corruption, while subsequently evolving alongside it.</p>
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="2.1.1.1" id="disparate-shared"><span class="secno">2.1.1.1. </span><span class="content">Applications must have a shared understanding of data</span><a class="self-link" href="#disparate-shared"></a></h5>
    Interoperability only
works when disparate applications can look at the same data set and confidently
understand that information in a consistent way. We believe this understanding
is shared at three levels. RDF, the basis of Solid’s Linked Data model provides
the first level through shared vocabularies. Data shapes provide the second
level by allowing us to define and share schemas that validate combinations of
RDF triples. Shape Trees let us marry constellations of resources validated by
these shape schemas into complex things to provide the third and final level. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="2.1.1.2" id="disparate-discoverable"><span class="secno">2.1.1.2. </span><span class="content">Data must be discoverable</span><a class="self-link" href="#disparate-discoverable"></a></h5>
    Applications must know where to write the data
they generate, and other applications need to know how to find it and use it. In
a decentralized data infrastructure, you cannot rely on data being in the same
location from one store to another. Clients need reliable mechanisms to discover
where to read and write data so they can interoperate over it. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="2.1.1.3" id="disparate-durable"><span class="secno">2.1.1.3. </span><span class="content">Data must be durable</span><a class="self-link" href="#disparate-durable"></a></h5>
    One application cannot break or corrupt the data being
used by others. The hippocratic oath swears doctors to “first, do no harm”, and
in similar fashion we must incorporate mechanics to prevent data corruption,
either through accident or malicious intent. We must also have ready mechanisms
in place to recover from data loss or corruption when it inevitably happens,
despite our best efforts. Some of the same schemas and shape trees used to
facilitate a shared understanding of data should be employed to validate the
same for durability. 
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="2.1.1.4" id="disparate-portable"><span class="secno">2.1.1.4. </span><span class="content">Data must be portable</span><a class="self-link" href="#disparate-portable"></a></h5>
    Data should be moveable between pods, across

use by the users' applications.

   <p>Data and Applications must have room to
evolve independently without negatively affecting the other key elements of
interoperability, hampering the end user experience, or violating secure data
boundaries already in place.</p>
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2.2" id="understand"><span class="secno">2.2. </span><span class="content">People must be able to understand what data they have to effectively use it or share it safely</span><a class="self-link" href="#understand"></a></h3>
   <p>Machine to machine interoperability between applications is essential, but human
to machine interoperability over that data is equally crucial. For people to be
able to control their data, or even use it effectively, they must be able to
understand what their data actually is.</p>
   <p>Linked Data affords us the capability to store anything, with data ranging from
the extremely simple to the highly complex. Yet while developers, engineers, and
data scientists may be comfortable working with hierarchies of resources
decorated with rich metadata, or graphs of information, regular users are not.
People think in terms of concrete things they understand. Photo albums, medical
records, notebooks, and chat rooms have meaning to people. Files and folders do
not. When people are working with their data, or making decisions about it, they
must do so based on intuitive data boundaries that they fully comprehend. Solid
has struggled up to this point to represent people’s data in an intuitive way
that makes sense to them. As a consequence, it’s difficult for them to manage
that data or use it effectively.</p>
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="2.2.1" id="understand-goal"><span class="secno">2.2.1. </span><span class="content">Goal: Use intuitive data boundaries to provide human to machine interoperability</span><a class="self-link" href="#understand-goal"></a></h4>
   <p>Our first goal from Problem #1  is to support machine to machine
interoperability so that applications can consistently interoperate. Solving
that problem and this one (#2) requires us to support human to machine
interoperability at the same time. This means that people must consistently
understand the data they have, so they can use it and share it effectively
across their collection of preferred applications. To do so requires us to find
one way to express information that both people and machines understand.</p>
   <p>RDF lets us describe relationships between things, attributes of a thing, in a
way that machines and (some) people understand. However, often when people are
thinking about their data, they tend towards less granular representations.</p>
   <p>Shapes come closer by providing schemas that map these relationships and/or
attributes into models that are much more useful for machines, and often
understandable to (some) people. Still they don’t always correspond 1:1 with a
“thing” in the real world that your average user understands, like a photo
album, a medical record, or a shopping cart, which are often much more complex
than a single shape can represent.</p>
   <p>Shape trees marry RDF vocabularies, shapes, and resources into “things” that
provide very detailed blueprints for machine to machine interoperability, while
at the same time allow us to model and represent things that people can easily
comprehend, like a chat room, a calendar of appointments, or the event stream
from a medical device. Consequently, we can use shape trees to provide data
boundaries that machines can interoperate with and humans can understand.</p>
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2.3" id="interoperate"><span class="secno">2.3. </span><span class="content">Disparate entities using different applications must be able to safely and effectively interoperate within their scope of authorization</span><a class="self-link" href="#interoperate"></a></h3>
   <p>Making data interoperable when one person is using multiple applications is
challenging. We compound that problem in Solid by addressing collaborative use
cases. This means that the same data will be manipulated not only by different
applications, but also by different people or automated agents.</p>
   <p>These disparate entities may only be authorized to access or manipulate specific
subsets of data. They’re also likely to have different needs based on different
patterns of use. Because Solid uses a hierarchical resource model, this means
that **any organizing scheme that we use for data in Solid must be designed with
authorization as the common denominator**. The controller of data must authorize
who and what can access that data, and we fail if they cannot do that in a way
that provides rational compartmentalization through an intuitive experience.</p>
   <p>Take a common use case, where a Solid Pod is *controlled* by one person; i.e.
Alice. The data stored inside of that Pod is Alice’s. As a controller of the
Pod, Alice needs the ability to authorize other agents (people and/or
applications) to access some or all of the data inside it.</p>
   <p>When deciding whether to authorize another person or application to access data
in her Pod, Alice is faced with four considerations:</p>
   <ol>
    <li data-md>
     <p>Is this entity (person or application) credible and trustworthy?</p>
    <li data-md>
     <p>What data should they be authorized to access?</p>
    <li data-md>
     <p>What level of access should they have?</p>
    <li data-md>
     <p>What will they use the data for?</p>
   </ol>
   <p>This is a complex decision-set that must be made by Alice continuously over
time, across a diverse spectrum of data and application workflows. We are
challenged to ensure Alice is making secure and informed choices, while
maintaining an optimal user experience.</p>
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="2.3.1" id="interoperate-goal"><span class="secno">2.3.1. </span><span class="content">Goal: Secure collaboration over intuitive data boundaries</span><a class="self-link" href="#interoperate-goal"></a></h4>
   <p>Sharing magnifies the importance of Problem #2, which states that people must
understand their data to use it effectively. Without a firm understanding of
what they have, people are ill-equipped to make smart and secure decisions about
what data should be shared and who it should be shared with. Consequently, the
goal to use intuitive data boundaries to provide human to machine
interoperability through shape trees is the key to solving this problem.</p>
   <p>Comprehension of data boundaries that are defined by shape trees aids
collaboration, because it allows users to readily determine what things they
want to share with other people or applications. Applications can communicate
the things they need access to in a language that people understand. People make
access decisions based on data boundaries that make sense to them. This makes
the experience intuitive and the data boundaries secure. Absent that, this
picture quickly gets confusing and proportionally more unusable and/or insecure.</p>
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="2.3.1.1" id="interoperate-trustworthiness"><span class="secno">2.3.1.1. </span><span class="content">Determining trustworthiness of entities</span><a class="self-link" href="#interoperate-trustworthiness"></a></h5>
   <p>Determining whether an entity is credible or trustworthy is a multi-faceted
problem. It can require assurances as to the integrity of an individual,
organization, or application at multiple levels. It is important to establish
patterns and frameworks through which different and/or complementary measures
for trustworthiness can be employed.</p>
   <p>Trusting an entity also extends to the applications used by that entity to
access shared data. If that entity is a server-side application, the application
and the entity are one and the same. If that entity is an individual, then the
applications they use or "pilot" must also factor into the estimation of their
trustworthiness.</p>
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="2.3.1.2" id="interoperate-shared"><span class="secno">2.3.1.2. </span><span class="content">Determining what data can be shared with entities and clients</span><a class="self-link" href="#interoperate-shared"></a></h5>
   <p>Alice must be equipped with the right amount of information, presented in an
intuitive manner, to make safe decisions when she grants access to her data. She
must prevent undue exposure to her data by giving out too much access, but at
the same time she needs to provide enough to support the workflows that led her
to share her data in the first place.</p>
   <p>Authorization must be intuitive. Applications and services must be able to
communicate the data they need access to in ways people understand, that map to
their understanding of the data they have. Intuitive data boundaries are logical
units of sharing and/or collaboration. Intuitive means that people understand
what they are sharing, the ramifications of what they are sharing, and how the
data will be used. We must avoid inadvertent access, where someone doesn’t
realize what they’re giving access to and exposes private data.</p>
   <h5 class="heading settled" data-level="2.3.1.3" id="interoperate-level"><span class="secno">2.3.1.3. </span><span class="content">Determining what level of access to provide entities and clients</span><a class="self-link" href="#interoperate-level"></a></h5>
   <p>Should entities and clients be able to read vs. write? Should they have control
access that allows them to change permissions? Elevated privileges should be
reserved for a minority of people and applications that are supremely trusted.
The application should be able to stipulate what modes of access it needs when
expressing the kind of things it requires access to. This should allow requests
to be presented to the user in an intuitive way, and limit the ability for an
application or entity to gain more access than it needs to operate.</p>
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2.4" id="organize"><span class="secno">2.4. </span><span class="content">People shouldn’t need to think about how to physically organize their data to use Solid</span><a class="self-link" href="#organize"></a></h3>
   <p>People struggle to choose organizational models for even the simplest types of
data, especially when it falls into multiple contexts, which happens often.
Regular users will not invest the time to maintain a complex hierarchy of
resources, and the similarly complex set of access control rules associated with
it. They shouldn’t need to worry about where a particular type of data needs to
be stored, nor should they have to hunt around to find the data they want. Data
must be organized in such a way that people can work with their things in an
intuitive and natural way, or they may abandon Solid for more convenient
alternatives.</p>
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="2.4.1" id="organize-goal"><span class="secno">2.4.1. </span><span class="content">Goal: Standard and flexible organizing model for data</span><a class="self-link" href="#organize-goal"></a></h4>
   <p>People shouldn’t need to think about how things are stored if they don’t want
to. They should have as much freedom as they like to make and modify how they
categorize their data, but shouldn’t be required to move it around to do so.
Things change and evolve, and they need a way to do this easily and safely over
the lifetime of their data without needing to worry about reorganizing trees and
breaking links.</p>
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="2.5" id="query"><span class="secno">2.5. </span><span class="content">When data is stored and secure, it should be queryable using any mechanism, and able to be requested in different representations</span><a class="self-link" href="#query"></a></h3>
   <p>Users must be able to query across their data, unencumbered by anything but lack
of authorization. This includes the ability to ask for any kind of things,
including new representations of data they already have, which may have been
stored and organized using different base models and data boundaries.</p>
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="2.5.1" id="query-goal"><span class="secno">2.5.1. </span><span class="content">Goal: Flexibility and support for different and evolving query mechanisms</span><a class="self-link" href="#query-goal"></a></h4>
   <p>Any organizing model must ensure that data is available for simple lookups and
complex queries alike. Organized correctly, we can facilitate rich lookups while
maintaining strong and logical authorization boundaries.</p>
   <p>The ability to support various query engines (i.e. SPARQL) and techniques (i.e.
Guided-Link-Traversal-Based Query Processing) over time without needing to alter
or change the underlying data or their associated authorization boundaries is
crucial to fostering the evolution of data and applications.</p>
   <p>Queries should be able to ask for different representations of data, and have
that data furnished based on what’s available, even if it was stored in a
different representation.</p>
   <p>The scope of this effort will not be to design such a query infrastructure, but
simply to ensure that such a query infrastructure can be supported by this
design, without requiring data people have stored and accumulated to change.</p>

   <p>Solid’s versatility and power come from the inherent simplicity of its design.
It is easy to make a complex system that can do a few things very well. It is
hard to make a simple system that can do many things well. Like the web, the
fundamental simplicity of Solid’s design is a strength, and should be protected.
While it should be acceptable to extend and optimize Solid, it should not be
acceptable to change any of the fundamentals core to its operation.</p>
   <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="2.6.1" id="fundamental-goal"><span class="secno">2.6.1. </span><span class="content">Goal: Optimize and extend, but do not change Solid fundamentals</span><a class="self-link" href="#fundamental-goal"></a></h4>
   <p>Any proposal to solve the stated problem areas must not do so at the expense of
changing fundamental attributes of the Solid specification. In general, a
fundamental change would mean that any MUST requirements of the Solid
specification should not be altered. Some optimizations can be proposed, but
none that would negate any of the base Solid requirements without extremely
legitimate reasons and overwhelming community support.</p>

   <p>We must be able to support data interoperability across applications while
